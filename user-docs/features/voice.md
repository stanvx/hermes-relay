# Voice Mode

Real-time voice conversation with your Hermes agent. Tap the mic in chat, speak,
and the agent speaks back. **No Relay required**: on a vanilla connection,
speech runs through your Hermes dashboard's audio routes — the same path the
official Hermes Desktop voice mode uses — with the server's configured STT/TTS
providers.

::: tip Two speech routes, picked automatically
- **Vanilla Hermes** — works on a vanilla Hermes install. The phone talks to your
  Hermes dashboard; if the dashboard requires sign-in, signing in once under
  **Manage** also unlocks voice for that connection.
- **Relay** — when the optional Relay is paired, voice prefers it: per-profile
  voice providers, streaming voice output, and the Realtime Agent engine.

You can pin either route under **Settings → Voice → Stable STT/TTS Route**;
the default *Auto* uses Relay when paired, otherwise Vanilla Hermes.
:::

The stable default engine is **Hermes Chat + Voice Output**: Hermes owns the
chat turn, tools, memory, approvals, and transcript, then the active speech
route renders the assistant response to audio. An opt-in **Realtime Agent**
engine is available for experimental provider-native speech work — it requires
a paired Relay, is visibly badged as Experimental in Voice Settings, and can be
switched off without changing the stable voice behavior.

## GPT-Live with a Codex subscription

Select **Settings → Voice → Output → Voice mode → GPT-Live** for continuous
WebRTC voice. GPT-Live handles ordinary conversation, general questions and
self-contained message drafts directly, keeping replies brief. Requests to send
messages, use tools, consult saved/private context or fetch current information
still go through Hermes in the current Dashboard chat. GPT-Live detects speech turns and spoken
interruptions automatically; Tap, Hold and Continuous presets do not control
this engine.

Install the Relay Dashboard plugin on the Hermes host and sign in under
**Manage** if the Dashboard requests authentication. On that same host, use
`codex login` or `hermes auth login openai-codex`. Pairing a Relay websocket and
setting an OpenAI API key are not required for this subscription engine. The
app selection does not require changing the host's `voice.chat_mode` setting.

The GPT-Live settings card shows server credential readiness, model and voice.
**Ready** confirms local credentials; starting a session verifies provider
access and WebRTC connectivity. The defaults are `gpt-live-1-codex` and `cove`.
Host operators can set `RELAY_GPT_LIVE_SUBSCRIPTION_MODEL` and
`RELAY_GPT_LIVE_SUBSCRIPTION_VOICE` in the Dashboard process environment, then
restart the Dashboard.

Tap the microphone to pause or resume listening. Pausing the microphone does
not stop a response already playing. Close Voice to end the call and release
both microphone and playback. Changing the connection or profile ends the live
session. Startup failures appear in Voice; retry after fixing the reported
problem. This selection never falls back to a metered API key or chained
STT/TTS. Select **Hermes Chat + Voice Output** explicitly to use that engine.

OAuth credentials remain on the server. The phone receives the SDP answer and
then sends WebRTC audio directly to the provider. The subscription transport
uses a private ChatGPT endpoint and may change independently of this app.

## What It Is

Voice mode is a layer on top of chat. In the stable engine, your voice is
transcribed to text, sent through the normal chat flow, and the agent's response
is rendered back to speech as it streams in. In the experimental Realtime Agent
engine, Android streams mic PCM through the relay to a native realtime provider
such as xAI/Grok Voice Agent or OpenAI Realtime, and the relay mirrors the
provider's live transcript, audio, and Hermes tool state into the same chat
timeline. The MorphingSphere — the same orb you see in the chat empty state —
expands to fill the screen and reacts to both your voice and the agent's.

- **Your voice** drives a subtle blue-purple "listening" state. Gentle breathing, surface wobble with your amplitude.
- **The agent's voice** drives a dramatic green-teal "speaking" state. The core goes white-hot on peaks, the data ring spins up to 4× speed on loud consonants.

Transcribed messages appear in your chat history as normal messages. Load the
session on another device and you'll see the transcript. Realtime Agent mirrors
its transcript, Hermes tool state, confirmation prompts, and final response into
that same chat timeline so you do not have to exit voice mode to see what
happened.

## Requirements

**On your server:**

- **Vanilla Hermes route (no Relay):** a current hermes-agent whose dashboard
  exposes the audio endpoints, with `stt:` and `tts:` configured in
  `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. If the dashboard is auth-gated, sign in once under
  **Manage** on the phone. Older builds without dashboard audio routes show
  "Not available on this Hermes build" in Voice Settings — update
  hermes-agent or pair Relay.
- **Relay route:** Hermes `stt:` settings for transcription and the
  relay-managed `voice_output:` renderer for assistant speech, with the
  legacy Hermes `tts:` section as the fallback path. Voice output defaults
  live in `~/.hermes-relay/config.yaml` or in a selected profile's
  experimental `voice_output:` section; provider secrets stay server-side.

Common speech output choices:

| Provider | API key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **xAI Grok TTS** | xAI key or server-side xAI OAuth | First-class relay speech renderer. Built-ins include `eve`, `ara`, `rex`, `sal`, and `leo`; relay can also list account custom voices when auth allows it. |
| **OpenAI TTS** | `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Relay speech renderer for OpenAI speech models. Uses OpenAI's documented built-in voice set. |
| **ElevenLabs** | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Cascaded streaming TTS comparison target. Relay can refresh account voices, models, and languages server-side. |
| **Hermes fallback TTS** | Depends on upstream provider | Used if relay voice output fails before audio starts. |

Realtime Agent native providers also run relay-side. `xai_realtime` uses the
relay-owned xAI API key or OAuth store. `openai_realtime` can use
`OPENAI_REALTIME_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY` on the
relay host, or a ChatGPT/Codex subscription login. Set
`RELAY_OPENAI_REALTIME_AUTH=codex_oauth` to require the subscription lane and
refuse metered API-key fallback; `auto` keeps API-key-first compatibility and
uses Codex OAuth only when no key is configured. The OAuth lane prefers Hermes'
`openai-codex` login and otherwise reads the local Codex CLI login. Credentials
are never stored on Android.

Five STT providers are supported:

| Provider | API key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Local (faster-whisper)** | None (free) | Default. Runs locally on your server. Models from `tiny` to `large-v3`. |
| **Local command** | — | Custom whisper binary via `HERMES_LOCAL_STT_COMMAND`. |
| **Groq** | `GROQ_API_KEY` | Free tier. `whisper-large-v3-turbo` — very fast. |
| **OpenAI Whisper** | `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY` | `whisper-1` or `gpt-4o-transcribe`. |
| **Mistral Voxtral** | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | `voxtral-mini-latest`. |

**On your phone:**

- Microphone permission (requested the first time you tap the mic).
- For Vanilla Hermes voice: a saved dashboard URL and dashboard sign-in when the
  dashboard requires auth.
- For Relay voice extras or Realtime Agent: a reachable relay at `:8767` with
  the voice routes available.

Relay voice mode can authenticate two ways: a paired Relay session token with
`voice:config`, `voice:stt`, and `voice:tts` grants, or the same saved Hermes API
key used for API-server fallback chat. That means relay-backed chat+voice-only
setups can skip full Relay pairing when only `/voice/*` is needed. The API-key
exception is limited to Relay voice routes and requires HTTPS outside loopback.
For a temporary plain-LAN phone test, run `hermes relay insecure-api-key on` on
the relay host, then turn it back off with `hermes relay insecure-api-key off`.

Before a Relay-backed voice turn is submitted, Android runs a fast relay health
preflight. If the host accepts TCP but does not answer HTTP, Relay voice fails
quickly with a Connections-facing error instead of sitting in Thinking until the
long realtime turn timeout expires. The check is recorded in **Settings ->
Diagnostics** and in the Relay detail sheet's recent activity tail.

## Entering Voice Mode

Open a chat and tap the microphone FAB in the bottom-right corner. The first time, Android will ask for microphone permission. Granting it opens the voice mode overlay immediately. Denying it shows a banner at the top — tap Dismiss and you can try again later.

To exit voice mode, tap the X in the top-right of the overlay.

Choose **Overlay** during an active turn before leaving Hermes to keep Voice
available as a wide compact bar over the app you are using. Android will request
display-over-other-apps access the first time. Expand it for transcript and
response details, minimize it to the existing bubble, or choose **Open full
voice** to return to Hermes without restarting the turn. This optional floating
control is separate from Android Assistant mode below.

## Interaction Modes

Change in **Settings → Voice → Interaction mode**. All three share the same overlay — only the mic button's behavior changes.

### Tap-to-talk (default)

- Tap the mic to start recording.
- Tap again to stop manually, or stay quiet for ~3 seconds and it'll auto-stop (threshold configurable in Voice Settings).
- Tap while the agent is speaking to **interrupt** — the current TTS stops and a fresh recording starts. If **Barge-in** is enabled (see below), you can also just start speaking — no tap needed.

### Hold-to-talk

- Press and hold the mic while you speak.
- Release to stop recording and send.
- Good for noisy environments where the silence detector would trip early.

### Continuous

- After the agent finishes speaking, the mic automatically re-activates for your next turn.
- A back-and-forth conversation without ever touching the screen.
- Tap the X to exit when you're done.

## Streaming Voice Output — Why It Feels Fast

Most voice modes wait for the full response, then synthesize all of it, then play. That's a minimum ~3-second latency on top of the LLM.

Hermes-Relay does **balanced client-side voice chunking**: as the agent streams
its response over SSE, the phone detects complete speech boundaries, batches
normal assistant prose into larger natural chunks, and renders those chunks
through the relay's `/voice/output/*` websocket. PCM audio streams directly to
Android playback while newer text continues arriving. Short tool/status lines
such as "I'm checking that" bypass the batcher so they stay immediate. If
streaming voice output fails before audio starts, the app falls back to
`/voice/synthesize`.

Result: first audio starts shortly after the agent begins replying, but normal
answers use fewer provider renders so tone, prosody, and volume stay more
consistent across the response.

## Voice Settings

**Settings → Voice** is organized into three tabs: **Output**, **Listening**,
and **Advanced**. Output keeps the engine, route, provider, model, voice, and
save actions together; Listening contains interaction presets and barge-in;
Advanced contains STT, host configuration, and the full-engine diagnostic test.

### Voice Engine

- **Voice engine** — Stable `Hermes Chat + Voice Output` or opt-in
  `Realtime Agent` with an Experimental badge.

The active engine controls which provider card appears below. Stable voice shows
the Hermes voice-output renderer settings. Realtime voice shows the Realtime
Agent provider settings.

### Global Voice Controls

These controls apply to Hermes Chat + Voice Output and Realtime Agent. GPT-Live uses automatic turn detection and its own microphone pause/resume controls:

- **Interaction mode** — Tap / Hold / Continuous
- **Silence threshold** — 1-10 seconds, default 3. Only applies in Tap-to-talk mode.
- **Auto-TTS** — reserved for future: speak all agent responses even when not in voice mode. Currently a placeholder.

### Barge-in

Lets you interrupt the agent by speaking while it is thinking or talking. One
listener stays active across the whole response, so the microphone does not
re-arm between generation and playback. It is **on by default** to match Hermes
Voice and can be disabled at any time.

- **Interrupt when I speak** — master toggle. Default on.
- **Sensitivity** — `Off / Low / Default / High` controls Silero's speech confirmation. Higher values react to quieter or shorter speech; Off disables detection without changing the master switch.
- **Room-noise threshold** — multiplier applied to the calibrated quiet-room RMS. The upstream default is `3×`; higher values require your speech to be louder relative to the room.
- **Playback grace** — ignores likely echo immediately after playback starts. The upstream default is `0.50 s`.
- **Resume after interruption** — default on. After you interrupt, if you then stay quiet for ~600 ms, the agent resumes reading from the next sentence of its response. A quick breath or "wait, actually…" that you decide not to finish won't throw away its answer. Turn off if you'd rather a hard cut every time.
- **VAD diagnostics** — optional Logcat detail for calibrated floor, RMS, threshold, phase, and decisions. Leave off unless tuning a device.

**Device compatibility.** If your phone doesn't support hardware echo cancellation (`AcousticEchoCanceler`), you'll see a warning badge next to the master toggle: *"Your device may have limited echo cancellation. Barge-in quality will vary."* You can still enable barge-in, but expect more false triggers from the phone's own speaker feeding back into the mic. **Using headphones fixes this entirely** — the mic never hears the TTS output, so VAD has nothing to confuse.

Before playback, the app samples roughly 450 ms of room noise and uses its 90th
percentile as the floor, with the same bounded generation/playback thresholds,
500 ms grace, and majority decision window as upstream Hermes. Calibration
frames do not trigger interruption. The detector follows real playback gaps,
uses the quieter generation threshold between output spans, and rearms grace
only after a gap of at least one second. The phone's speaker therefore cannot
teach calibration the wrong noise floor. As soon as you start speaking, the agent's voice
briefly ducks in volume (about 30%). Sustained, model-confirmed speech stops the
active generation or playback and captures your replacement request. A false
trigger returns to full volume after about 500 ms.

**Stop phrases** default to exact bare “stop” and can be edited as a
comma-separated list; clearing the list disables them. A match ends the active
voice chat during generation or playback. Outside voice chat, and for longer
requests such as “stop the container,” the words go to the agent normally.
Exact pause/resume controls remain specific to Continuous mode.

When you interrupt spoken playback and continue with a new request, Standard
Voice privately tells the next model turn that its prior spoken reply was cut
off. That one-shot context expires after two minutes and is never added to the
visible or persisted transcript. Stopping speech does not cancel a promoted
background task; use the task's explicit cancel action or say the explicit
background-task cancellation command.

### Android Digital Assistant

Hermes can optionally become Android's default Digital Assistant, similar to
Home Assistant's assistant integration. This is the supported path for
system-mediated background and locked-screen invocation.

1. Open **Settings → Voice → Listening**.
2. Under **Android Digital Assistant**, tap **Choose Hermes**.
3. Grant microphone permission and confirm Hermes in Android's role dialog.
4. Return to Voice settings and enable **Background “Hey Hermes”** if you want
   continuous wake detection.

Hermes never changes the default assistant silently. Once selected, the system
assistant gesture or power-button shortcut can open a Hermes session even when
continuous wake is off. Android presents a real assistant session and hands it
to the existing voice flow; Standard voice still uses the upstream Dashboard
audio routes and does not require Relay.

Assistant invocation opens as a compact bar over the current screen. Tap the
up arrow to expand transcript and response details, then collapse it without
ending the turn. **Open full voice** continues the same request in Hermes'
existing Voice screen without restarting the session or handing the microphone
to a second recorder. Back collapses an expanded assistant first; Back from the
compact bar or Stop closes the assistant turn normally.

The optional background listener uses the same Android-local sherpa model and
keeps pre-activation audio on the phone. It releases the microphone before the
assistant session starts listening and resumes after the session closes. It is
separate from the experimental notification-based listener below; enabling
either wake mode disables the other.

To pause continuous listening but keep gesture invocation, turn off
**Background “Hey Hermes”**. To remove Hermes as the default assistant, tap
**Android settings** and choose another assistant or **None**.

Third-party assistants do not receive Google's dedicated low-power hotword
hardware. Continuous local microphone and CPU use can therefore have a
noticeable battery cost; leave background wake off if gesture-only invocation
is enough. The integration does not use accessibility, overlay permission,
full-screen intents, server wake listeners, or Picovoice credentials.

### Experimental wake word

Under **Voice Settings → Listening**, enable **Listen for “Hey Hermes”** to use
the Android-local wake-word preview. It is off by default. The first enable
downloads and verifies an English keyword model of about 6 MB. The APK includes
the sherpa-onnx runtime but not the model.

Detection runs on the phone: microphone audio is not uploaded before the phrase
activates voice. Android requires a user-started microphone foreground service,
shows an ongoing privacy notification, and provides a **Stop** action. The
listener does not start at boot. When the phrase is detected, the wake listener
releases the microphone before the normal voice flow records anything, stays
paused for the voice session, then resumes after voice exits.

The initial preview supports one phrase, “Hey Hermes.” **Strictness** controls
false activations (higher is stricter), **Confirmation frames** controls how
many matching decoder frames are required, and **Start a new session** chooses
between a fresh chat and the selected profile's current session.
Profile-specific wake phrases and routing are not supported yet. Continuous
local listening uses additional battery and still needs device-specific
acoustic testing.

### Hermes Chat + Voice Output

Visible when the `Hermes Chat + Voice Output` engine is selected. It edits
streaming voice output defaults for the active profile. Provider, model, voice,
language, and sample-rate dropdowns come from the relay's advertised provider
metadata. When you pick a provider, the app asks the relay for that provider's
latest safe options before saving; account-backed discovery, such as ElevenLabs
voice/model lists and paginated xAI custom voices, happens on the server and is
cached briefly to avoid repeated provider API calls.
OpenAI voice choices are static from the official API docs because OpenAI does
not provide a general voice-list endpoint for this surface. The picker groups
provider voices, supports search for long voice lists, marks recommended/custom
voices where the relay can tell, and validates model/voice/sample-rate
compatibility before saving. The provider is summarized with its advertised
model and voice counts. The selected model and recommended voices are grouped
in one card, with a searchable **View all voices** picker for larger catalogs.
**Advanced manual entry** lets you type raw IDs for
providers or voices the relay does not advertise yet; those save as warnings
rather than hard failures unless the relay knows the combination is incompatible.
Saving while a profile is selected writes that profile's experimental
`voice_output:` section, so `mizuki` can use one voice and `victor` another.

Inline play buttons beside the model and individual voices open an ephemeral
voice-output session with the current draft provider/model/voice/language/sample
rate. Previewing does **not** save the draft. Only one preview can play at once;
the active row shows the same speaking waveform used by voice mode and its play
button becomes Stop. **Discard** restores the saved profile values, while
**Save** validates and persists the draft independently.

When the streaming provider is **xAI Grok TTS**, an **Expressive speech tags**
switch appears here. With it on, the relay injects xAI's inline/wrapping tone
markers (whisper, laugh, sigh, build/decrease intensity, pitch shifts) into the
streamed speech — the streaming-renderer equivalent of the per-request tone tags.
It saves per-profile with the other voice-output settings.

The older Hermes `tts:` config is still shown as fallback provider information
and is still used if streaming voice output fails before audio starts.

### Enhanced Voice (Gemini & xAI)

When the relay's basic TTS provider supports per-request enhanced control, an
**Enhanced Voice** card appears, titled for the provider (e.g. *Enhanced Voice
(Gemini)*). It lets you steer voice and tone **per request** without editing
server config — the relay maps your choices onto the active provider and never
writes them to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. Leave any field on **Server default** to
defer to the saved config.

- **Gemini** — pick a prebuilt voice, choose the model, and turn on
  **Expressive tone tags** (requires a Gemini 3.1 TTS model). With tags on, a
  hidden rewrite adds cues like `[whispers]` or `[excitedly]` to the spoken
  script; if your server can't run that rewrite it falls back silently to plain
  speech. An optional **Voice direction** field takes free-form performance
  notes ("Warm, calm narrator; unhurried pace.").
- **xAI / Grok** — type a voice id and turn on **Expressive speech tags** (xAI's
  inline/wrapping markers: whisper, laugh, sigh, build/decrease intensity, pitch
  shifts), with an optional language hint.

Two scoping notes:

- **Relay-only.** On the Vanilla Hermes (no-plugin) path the dashboard
  `/api/audio/speak` endpoint accepts only the text to speak, so enhanced voice
  there is whatever the server's `tts.<provider>.*` config sets — change it under
  **Manage**, and it applies to every voice turn, not per utterance.
- **Which path it drives.** This card's per-request overrides ride
  `/voice/synthesize`, used when the streaming voice-output renderer above is off
  or unavailable (and as the fallback when streaming fails). For the **streaming**
  renderer — the default for relay playback — xAI's expressive speech tags are
  controlled by the **Expressive speech tags** switch in the **Hermes Chat +
  Voice Output** card above (saved per-profile via `voice_output:`), and voice is
  the voice-output provider voice. Gemini is synthesize-only (the streaming
  renderer has no Gemini provider). Providers without an enhanced surface
  (ElevenLabs, MiniMax, Mistral, OpenAI, local engines) stay config-only.

Stable streaming playback can resume during short connection changes. If the
phone moves from Wi-Fi to cellular or from LAN to Tailscale while audio is in
flight, Android reopens the same relay voice-output session through the current
route and the relay replays missed PCM chunks instead of forcing a new render.

### Speech-to-Text

Read-only display of the STT provider and model reported by `/voice/config`.
STT still follows the upstream Hermes `stt:` configuration for the stable
Hermes Chat + Voice Output engine, resolved through the active profile where
Hermes has one. Realtime Agent uses the selected provider's native realtime
transcription instead and does not upload the turn through `/voice/transcribe`.

### Realtime Agent

Visible when the `Realtime Agent` voice engine is selected. This experimental
section saves profile-scoped realtime provider defaults (`realtime_voice:`) for
provider-native testing. Native Realtime Agent providers currently include
`xai_realtime` with `grok-voice-latest` and `openai_realtime` with
`gpt-realtime-2`. Victor's profile can select `leo` for xAI, while OpenAI
profiles commonly use voices such as `marin` or `cedar`. Provider dropdowns use
the same relay-owned option refresh, search, grouping, and validation pattern as
Voice Output, plus a native-agent capability flag so lab/render-only providers
do not appear as full Realtime Agent choices.

Realtime Agent is still Hermes-first. The provider does not get raw Android
bridge tools, direct Hermes tool execution, or ownership of memory. The relay
broker exposes only a small tool surface:

- `hermes_run_task`
- `hermes_get_status`
- `hermes_cancel`
- `hermes_confirm`

When the phone is paired, its Relay session token only authenticates it to the
realtime route. Hermes tool calls from the realtime broker use the relay
server's local Hermes API credential from `config.yaml`, `.env`, or
`API_SERVER_KEY`; the provider never receives the phone's saved API key.

During Hermes tool work, the app shows clean status from the broker instead of
dumping raw tool output into voice. Normal timeline rows show the active Hermes
tool, completion state, and provider-spoken provenance. Android keeps those
status updates UI-only during provider-native realtime playback so a second
voice-output stream cannot compete with the realtime provider. The final spoken
answer is generated by the realtime provider after Hermes returns a compact
result, so tool output is summarized naturally instead of read aloud.

#### Background tasks

Some requests take a while — research, multi-step work, a long command. Instead
of freezing the conversation until they finish, Realtime Agent **promotes** a
slow run to the background: the agent says a short "I'm on it" and you can keep
talking, ask something else, or just wait. When the task finishes, the agent
speaks the answer. Asking for something explicitly long starts a background task
right away.

You control this under **Voice Settings → Realtime Agent → Background tasks**:

- **Promote long tasks** — turn the behavior on or off. With it off, the agent
  waits silently until the task finishes (the old behavior).
- **Spoken handoff** — whether the agent says a short acknowledgement when a task
  moves to the background, or just shows it on screen.
- **When the answer is ready** — *Speak* it as soon as you're not mid-sentence,
  *Notify* and speak when you re-engage, or *Show only* (no spoken answer).

While a background task is running, a small "working on it" chip stays visible in
the voice screen. You can cancel a background task at any time the same way you
cancel any turn. Hermes still owns the task end-to-end — promotion only changes
*when* the answer is spoken, never who runs the tools.

Provider-native Android paths stream mic PCM to a relay-owned realtime provider
WebSocket session. Android commits the captured utterance, the active provider
owns input transcription and speech generation, and Hermes still owns profile
binding, session history, memory, tools, confirmation prompts, cancellation
policy, and transcript persistence. The relay sends the provider only the
approved Hermes function schemas, returns compact tool results, and waits for
Android playback to drain before asking the provider for post-tool narration. If
the provider disconnects or quality is poor, switch Voice engine back to
`Hermes Chat + Voice Output`; existing voice routes and settings remain intact.

Realtime Agent sessions use the same resume window during short connection
changes. If the phone moves from Wi-Fi to cellular or from LAN to Tailscale
while a turn is thinking or speaking, Android follows the app's current relay
route signal and can reopen the same relay voice session before the old
websocket times out. It sends a session resume token and its last received
audio/event IDs, and the relay replays missed status or PCM chunks instead of
starting a second Hermes run. Android waits for the relay's resume confirmation
before sending another recorded turn, and retries for a bounded window that
starts when the route is lost. If that window expires, the app detaches the old
task status, shows a recoverable voice error, and the next tap starts a fresh
turn; a durable Hermes task may still report through chat or notification.

Voice turns include interface context. In stable voice mode the chat agent is
told the turn came through `Hermes Chat + Voice Output`; in Realtime Agent mode
the provider and Hermes broker are told the active path is `realtime_agent`,
including provider, model, voice, profile, and relay-local date/time. If you ask
which path is active or what today's date is, the agent should answer from that
context.

Realtime Agent also receives recent shared chat context from the current
timeline. That means switching from normal chat voice to Realtime Agent, then
back again, should feel like one conversation. If the realtime provider answers
a simple prompt-contained question directly, the app syncs that local
provider-only turn into the next Hermes chat turn. If the turn used Hermes tools,
Hermes already has the canonical record and the app does not duplicate the tool
output.

For research, news, current facts beyond the injected date/time, live checks, or
anything else the realtime provider cannot know from the active context, the
provider is instructed to call Hermes instead of guessing from model knowledge.
That also covers latest/versioned data, device or desktop state, personal or
project context, side effects, precision-sensitive answers, explicit
check/verify/look-up requests, media or artifact handling, and follow-up
references like "this", "that", "it", or "that integration" that need durable
chat/session context. Hermes performs the governed check, then the provider
speaks a concise summary from Hermes' returned answer.

Realtime Agent also asks the provider to format speech for listening: dates,
times, currency, percentages, versions, measurements, counts, paths, URLs, IDs,
JSON, logs, tables, and dense numeric strings should be summarized naturally
instead of read character by character. When raw values are not useful aloud, the
voice can say something like "plus a few IDs and raw values" and keep the meaning
front and center.

The default Realtime Agent timeline stays user-facing: live transcript,
assistant speech, path badges, confirmation state, and compact tool rows. Turn
on **Detailed trace** in Voice settings to show compact Hermes status and result
provenance for debugging. Full raw traces stay in the relay run logs.

**Reliable, low-latency playback.** Realtime audio plays from the first frame
with minimal latency. Earlier builds could drop or stutter the first turn because
the AudioTrack deep buffer cold-started with its playback head parked at zero;
the streaming buffer was reduced to a low-latency size, the prebuffer threshold
retuned, and the preroll force-start removed. Playback now records a
time-to-first-audio metric, logs the requested-vs-actual buffer size, runs a
first-frame watchdog, and cross-checks drain drift. When something goes wrong,
those signals land in **Settings -> Diagnostics** instead of presenting as silent
dead air.

### Test Current Engine

When `Hermes Chat + Voice Output` is selected, plays a sample sentence ("Hello,
this is Hermes. Voice mode is working.") through the currently saved profile
voice-output path. When `Realtime Agent` is selected, opens a provider-native
`/voice/realtime-agent/*` session and plays a short realtime sample through the
relay. The fallback TTS card is global and remains visible for both engines as
the stable speech safety net.

### Voice Lab

The realtime voice test screen (the "Voice Lab") is a developer-facing harness
for exercising the realtime path in isolation, with two clearly separated demos:

- **Text demo** — plays raw provider TTS directly, with no agent in the loop. Use
  it to confirm the provider, voice, and streaming playback are healthy.
- **Mic demo** — runs the full agent path: real speech recognition, Hermes
  brokering, and a spoken reply. Capture is tap-to-record / tap-to-stop, so you
  control exactly when the utterance is committed.

The Voice Lab waveform follows the playback cursor — it is driven by the player's
amplitude at the current playback position rather than by socket-arrival time, so
the visual matches what you actually hear. A `scripts/realtime-voice-lab-smoke.ps1`
script automates a quick end-to-end check of the lab routes.

## Troubleshooting

**"Microphone permission is required for voice mode"** — tap the mic FAB again. If Android doesn't show a permission prompt (you denied twice), go to Android Settings → Apps → Hermes-Relay → Permissions → Microphone and enable it.

**No audio plays when the agent speaks** — check Settings → Voice → Hermes Chat + Voice Output. The **Render path** row tells you which path renders speech: *streaming (/voice/output)* when the renderer is active, or *basic synthesize (/voice/synthesize)* when it's off or unavailable (the streaming "Expressive speech tags" toggle only applies on the streaming path). If the provider shows "Unknown" or the profile scope is not what you expected, the relay's `/voice/output/config` or `/voice/config` endpoint returned an error or fell back. Try Test Current Engine; the error message will tell you what's wrong. Settings → Diagnostics also logs the active render path per session.

**Transcript comes back empty or garbled** — check Settings → Voice → Speech-to-Text. Same diagnostic: Test Current Engine won't catch stable STT issues, but you can verify by speaking a slow, clear phrase and watching the transcribed text appear in the overlay. If it's wrong, your STT model or language setting is off.

**The sphere doesn't react during Speaking on my device** — some Android OEMs refuse to construct the `Visualizer` audio-effect object even with `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` granted. Hermes-Relay catches this and falls back to a flat amplitude — voice mode still works, the orb just won't pulse with the agent's voice. Listening-mode amplitude (from your mic) is unaffected.

**"Relay returned 503"** — your server doesn't have the provider's optional dependencies installed. SSH into the server and `pip install` whichever provider you configured (e.g. `pip install edge-tts` for Edge, `pip install elevenlabs` for ElevenLabs, or `pip install faster-whisper` for local STT).

**"Relay returned 413" on synthesize** — you're trying to synthesize more than 5000 characters at once. This is a safety cap on the relay side to avoid runaway TTS costs. Client-side sentence chunking should normally keep individual requests well under this, so a 413 usually means the agent returned one enormous uninterrupted sentence.

**"That pairing code was already used"** — Relay pairing codes are one-shot. Generate a fresh QR from the dashboard Relay tab or `hermes pair` and scan again. If you only need chat plus standard voice, skip Relay pairing and use the Dashboard/Gateway connection; the same dashboard session authorizes both.

## Privacy Note

Voice audio goes through the active speech route: the upstream Dashboard for
standard Vanilla Hermes voice, or Relay for optional enhanced/realtime engines.
From there it reaches whichever provider you configured. If you're using a cloud
provider (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Groq, Mistral), your audio goes to them. If you're
using local providers (faster-whisper, NeuTTS, Edge TTS), nothing leaves your network.

The mp3 files returned from `/voice/synthesize` are cached briefly in the app's cache directory and cleared automatically as new ones arrive (capped at 6 at a time). On the server side, the relay writes each `/voice/synthesize` render to a private temp file and deletes it after streaming, so relay synthesis no longer accumulates files in `~/voice-memos/` (other Hermes agent voice features may still use that directory).

## Voice over other apps

Voice Overlay is optional in both builds. Start it explicitly from Voice Focus while Hermes-Relay is visible and unlocked. It requires microphone access, display-over-other-apps access and an enabled microphone notification with Stop voice. Audio goes to the configured Hermes server; the overlay does not read or control other apps. Stop voice, closing the overlay, screen lock, task removal or loss of required access ends the overlay voice session. Returning to the app keeps foreground protection until the app is resumed. Granting permissions never starts a session.

Open **Chat → Voice Focus → Overlay**. Review the explanation, grant only the missing permissions in Android, return, and tap **Start voice overlay**. Permission refusal leaves in-app voice available. Review access later in **Settings → Voice → Listening** or **Settings → Permissions**. The expanded panel can reset its position. Every panel size exposes Stop voice.
